# 🚀 Project Manager App — MERN Stack (React Router Version)

Hi 👋 I'm **Usman Ahmad**, and I built this **Project & Task Management App** as part of my MERN stack journey — focusing on how real-world teams organize projects, track progress, and stay productive.

---

## 🧠 About the Project

This is a **full-stack Project Management System** where users can:
- 🧾 **Sign up / Log in securely** (JWT Auth + bcrypt password hashing)
- 📁 **Create & manage projects**
- ✅ **Add, update, and delete tasks** under each project
- 🔐 **Access personalized dashboards** only after authentication

I built this to understand how **frontend-backend integration** really works — from **Express APIs & MySQL database** to **React routing and state management**.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React, React Router, Tailwind CSS  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MySQL  
**Auth:** JWT, bcrypt  
**Other Tools:** Axios, REST APIs, CORS, dotenv  

---

## 💡 Key Features

- ✨ Clean and intuitive **UI** using React + Tailwind  
- 🔒 Secure **login & signup** with JWT-based authentication  
- 🗂️ **Project CRUD** operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- 🧩 **Task CRUD** under each project  
- ⚡ Reusable components and well-structured routes  
- 🧭 Protected routes with middleware for auth validation

## 🌍 Future Enhancements

- 💬 Team collaboration & comments
- ☁️ Deployment on Render / Vercel / Railway
- 🧾 Activity logs for each user

## 🧑‍💻 What I Learned

While building this, I understood how to:
- Connect React with a backend API using Axios  
- Implement **JWT authentication** and route protection  
- Design MySQL schemas for **projects and tasks**  
- Handle CRUD operations both frontend & backend  
- Manage **state and navigation** using React Router
